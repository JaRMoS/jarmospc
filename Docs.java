 * @defgroup jarmospc JaRMoS PC
 * @short JaRMoS package for reduced simulations on desktop computers
 * 
 * \note This module depends on \ref jarmosbase, \ref jkermor and \ref jrb.
 * 
 * This package enables simple simulation of JaRMoS models on a desktop environment. The current status lacks any GUI
 * interface for model selection. This yet has to be done in the jarmos.pc.Main program.
 * 
 * JaRMoSPC uses the JOGL framework for rendering the simulation results using Java-based OpenGL (with native libraries
 * for different platforms)
 * 
 * Get latest JOGL/GlueGen OpenGL package from http://jogamp.org/wiki/index.php/Downloading_and_installing_JOGL
 * 
 * Current version includes selected files from
 * http://jogamp.org/deployment/archive/master/gluegen_646-joal_408-jogl_930-jocl_756/archive/jogamp-all-platforms.7z
